Type checker for a CSV file inspired by [strong_json](https://github.com/soutaro/strong_json).

**Motivation**

Some applications have a feature to receive a CSV file uploaded by a user,
and in general, it needs to validate each cell of the CSV file.

How should applications validate them?
Of course, it depends, but there would be common validation logic for CSV files.
For example, some columns may have to be integers because of database requirements.
It would be cumbersome to write such validations always.

strong_json helps you to mitigate such a drudgery by letting you declare desired types beforehand.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'strong_csv'
```

And then execute:

```console
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```console
gem install strong_csv
```

## Usage

TBD: This hasn't yet been implemented.

```ruby
require "strong_csv"

strong_csv = StrongCSV.new do
  let :stock, integer
  let :tax_rate, float
  let :name, string(within: 1..255)
  let :description, string?(within: 1..1000)
  let :active, boolean
  let :started_at, time?
  let :data, any?

  # Literal declaration
  let :status, 0..6
  let :priority, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
  let :size, "S", "M", "L" do |value|
    case value
    when "S"
      1
    when "M"
      2
    when "L"
      3
    end
  end

  # Regular expressions
  let :url, %r{\Ahttps://}

  # Custom validation.
  #
  # This example sees the database to fetch exactly stored `User` IDs,
  # and it checks the `:user_id` cell really exists in the `users` table.
  # `pick` would be useful to avoid N+1 problems.
  pick :user_id, as: :user_ids do |ids|
    User.where(id: ids).ids
  end
  let :user_id, integer { |i| user_ids.include?(i) }
end

data = <<~CSV
  stock,tax_rate,name,active,status,priority,size,url
  12,0.8,special item,True,4,20,M,https://example.com
CSV

strong_csv.parse(data, field_size_limit: 2048) do |row|
  if row.valid?
    row[:tax_rate] # => 0.8
    row[:active] # => true
    # do something with row
  else
    row.errors # => { user_id: ["must be present", "must be an integer"] }
    # do something with row.errors
  end
end
```

## Available types

| Type                                           | Description                                                               | Example                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `integer`                                      | The value must be casted to Integer                                       | `let :stock, integer`               |
| `float`                                        | The value must be casted to Float                                         | `let :rate, float`                  |
| `boolean`                                      | The value must be casted to Boolean                                       | `let :active, boolean`              |
| `string` OR `string(within: 1..10)`            | The value must be casted to String                                        | `let :name, string(within: 1..255)` |
| `1`, `2`, ... (Integer literal)                | The value must be casted to the specific Integer literal                  | `let :id, 3`                        |
| `1..10`, `1.0..30`, `"a".."z"` (Range literal) | The value must be casted to the beginning of Range and be covered with it | `let :id, 10..30`                   |
| `"abc"`, `"bar"` (String literal)              | The value must be casted to the specific String literal                   | `let :drink, "coffee"`              |
| , (Union type)                                 | The value must satisfy one of the subtypes                                | `let :id, 1, 2, 3`                  |
